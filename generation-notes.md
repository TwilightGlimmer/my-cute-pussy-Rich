## prompts\base-pet.md

Create one clean full-body reference sprite for Codex pet Jade.

Pet identity: Full body tuxedo cat matching photographs: black short fur, large yellow-green eyes, narrow white nose bridge stripe, white muzzle, mostly black nose with small pink edge, large white chest bib, smaller white belly patch, black legs with white toe tips, complete ears paws and tail. No accessories. Preserve natural adult cat proportions..
Style: Pet-safe sprite: compact full-body mascot, readable in a 192x208 cell, clear silhouette, simple face, stable palette/materials, and crisp edges for chroma-key extraction. Style `auto`: Infer the most appropriate pet-safe style from the user request and reference images, then keep that exact style consistent across every row. User style notes: Soft realistic fur illustration, faithful likeness to reference cat, readable at small size, whole body always visible, no surrounding scenery.


Place a single centered pose on a perfectly flat pure blue #0000FF chroma-key background. Keep the full pet visible, compact, readable at 192x208, and easy to animate. Preserve approved reference identity cues. No scenery, text, borders, checkerboard transparency, shadows, glows, detached effects, or extra props. Keep #0000FF and close colors out of the pet, props, highlights, and effects.


## prompts\rows\failed.md

Create one horizontal animation strip for Codex pet `jade`, state `failed`.

Use the attached canonical base for identity. Use the attached layout guide only for slot count, spacing, centering, and padding; do not draw the guide.

Output exactly 8 full-body frames in one left-to-right row on flat pure blue #0000FF. Treat the row as 8 invisible equal-width slots: one centered complete pose per slot, evenly spaced, with no overlap, clipping, empty slots, labels, or borders.

Identity: same pet in every frame: Full body tuxedo cat matching photographs: black short fur, large yellow-green eyes, narrow white nose bridge stripe, white muzzle, mostly black nose with small pink edge, large white chest bib, smaller white belly patch, black legs with white toe tips, complete ears paws and tail. No accessories. Preserve natural adult cat proportions.. Preserve silhouette, face, proportions, markings, palette, material, style, and props.
Style: Pet-safe sprite: compact full-body mascot, readable in a 192x208 cell, clear silhouette, simple face, stable palette/materials, and crisp edges for chroma-key extraction. Style `auto`: Infer the most appropriate pet-safe style from the user request and reference images, then keep that exact style consistent across every row. User style notes: Soft realistic fur illustration, faithful likeness to reference cat, readable at small size, whole body always visible, no surrounding scenery.
Animation continuity: keep apparent pet scale and baseline stable within the row unless the state itself intentionally changes vertical position, such as `jumping`. Move the pose within the slot instead of redrawing the pet larger or smaller frame to frame.

State action: Blocked/failed loop: slumped or deflated reaction with sad or closed eyes.

State requirements:
- Show failure through slumped pose, drooping ears/limbs, closed or sad eyes, and lower body position.
- Tears, small smoke puffs, or tiny stars are allowed only if attached to or overlapping the pet silhouette and kept inside the same frame slot.
- Do not draw red X marks, floating symbols, detached stars, separated smoke clouds, falling tear drops, dust, or other loose effects.

Clean extraction: crisp opaque edges, safe padding, no scenery, text, guide marks, checkerboard, shadows, glows, motion blur, speed lines, dust, detached effects, stray pixels, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.


## prompts\rows\idle.md

Create one horizontal animation strip for Codex pet `jade`, state `idle`.

Use the attached canonical base for identity. Use the attached layout guide only for slot count, spacing, centering, and padding; do not draw the guide.

Output exactly 6 full-body frames in one left-to-right row on flat pure blue #0000FF. Treat the row as 6 invisible equal-width slots: one centered complete pose per slot, evenly spaced, with no overlap, clipping, empty slots, labels, or borders.

Identity: same pet in every frame: Full body tuxedo cat matching photographs: black short fur, large yellow-green eyes, narrow white nose bridge stripe, white muzzle, mostly black nose with small pink edge, large white chest bib, smaller white belly patch, black legs with white toe tips, complete ears paws and tail. No accessories. Preserve natural adult cat proportions.. Preserve silhouette, face, proportions, markings, palette, material, style, and props.
Style: Pet-safe sprite: compact full-body mascot, readable in a 192x208 cell, clear silhouette, simple face, stable palette/materials, and crisp edges for chroma-key extraction. Style `auto`: Infer the most appropriate pet-safe style from the user request and reference images, then keep that exact style consistent across every row. User style notes: Soft realistic fur illustration, faithful likeness to reference cat, readable at small size, whole body always visible, no surrounding scenery.
Animation continuity: keep apparent pet scale and baseline stable within the row unless the state itself intentionally changes vertical position, such as `jumping`. Move the pose within the slot instead of redrawing the pet larger or smaller frame to frame.

State action: Calm low-distraction resting loop: subtle breathing, tiny blink, slight head/body bob, and only quiet persona-preserving motion.

State requirements:
- CRITICAL: idle is the low-distraction baseline state and the first frame is also used as the reduced-motion static pet.
- Use only subtle idle motion: gentle breathing, a tiny blink, a slight head or body bob, a very small material sway, or another quiet motion that fits the pet persona.
- Keep the pet essentially in the same pose, facing direction, silhouette, markings, palette, and prop state across all 6 frames.
- Idle variation must stay calm but still read as animation; do not repeat effectively identical copies across the loop.
- Do not show waving, walking, running, jumping, talking, working, reviewing, emotional reactions, large gestures, item interactions, or new props.
- Feet, base, body, or object anchor should remain planted or nearly planted.
- The first and last frames should be very close visually so the loop feels calm and does not pop.

Clean extraction: crisp opaque edges, safe padding, no scenery, text, guide marks, checkerboard, shadows, glows, motion blur, speed lines, dust, detached effects, stray pixels, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.

Animation continuity: keep apparent pet scale and baseline stable within the row unless the state itself intentionally changes vertical position, such as `jumping`. Move the pose within the slot instead of redrawing the pet larger or smaller frame to frame.

State action: Hover jump loop: anticipation, lift, airborne peak, descent, and settle through body height.

State requirements:
- Show the jump through pose and vertical body position only: anticipation, lift, airborne peak, descent, settle.
- Do not draw ground shadows, contact shadows, drop shadows, oval shadows, landing marks, dust, smears, bounce pads, or motion marks under the pet.
- Keep the background outside the pet perfectly flat chroma key with no darker key-colored patches.

## prompts\rows\look-row-10.md

Create one horizontal look-direction strip for Codex pet `jade`, atlas row 10.

Use the attached canonical base, completed standard contact sheet, layout guide, and approved four-cardinal strip for identity, scale, registration, spacing, direction semantics, and cross-row continuity. Read `qa/look-mechanics.md` and follow its pet-specific movement and eye/prop mechanics. The approved cardinal strip and completed coherent row 9 are authoritative. Use the cardinals for direction meaning and row 9 for cross-row identity, scale, registration, and continuity.

COHERENT SYNTHESIS LOCK: produce one unified eight-pose row. Do not paste, tile, or independently restyle individual cells. Every final cell must be drawn together with the same face construction, body proportions, line/render quality, lighting, materials, scale, baseline, and registration.

Output exactly 8 complete full-body frames in this exact left-to-right order: 180, 202.5, 225, 247.5, 270, 292.5, 315, 337.5. Degrees are clockwise: 000 is up, 090 right, 180 down, and 270 left. Neutral/front is not part of this row.

DIRECTION TARGETS — use these to shape the coherent row, not as pixel-level landmark gates:

1. `180`: vertical DOWN; no horizontal requirement.
2. `202.5`: horizontal SCREEN-LEFT and vertical DOWN.
3. `225`: horizontal SCREEN-LEFT and vertical DOWN.
4. `247.5`: horizontal SCREEN-LEFT and vertical DOWN.
5. `270`: horizontal SCREEN-LEFT; no vertical requirement.
6. `292.5`: horizontal SCREEN-LEFT and vertical UP.
7. `315`: horizontal SCREEN-LEFT and vertical UP.
8. `337.5`: horizontal SCREEN-LEFT and vertical UP.

Cardinals must be unmistakable. Intermediate poses should broadly occupy the intended quadrant and advance naturally through the ordered loop. Minor pupil, nose, eyelid, or aiming-feature deviations are acceptable when the overall direction, continuity, identity, and motion remain coherent. Do not deform the character merely to make every intermediate axis independently obvious.

SCREEN-COORDINATE LOCK: screen-left means the viewer's left image edge, never the character's own left. The row should travel naturally through the left half of the loop. Near-vertical 202.5 and 337.5 may have subtle horizontal cues; prioritize a coherent arc over exact pupil or nose placement.

HARD LAYOUT AND CONTINUITY CONTRACT — DETERMINISTIC REGISTRATION: draw exactly eight separated pose groups in left-to-right direction order. Keep enough chroma-only space between neighboring poses that each complete pose can be detected without cutting through foreground. Approximate the guide's equal spacing, but do not distort a pose merely to hit an exact source-canvas coordinate; deterministic assembly will crop the eight ordered groups, then apply one shared scale and baseline.

Use the same body height, head size, baseline, and planted-body position across the generated family. Never overlap neighboring poses, merge two poses into one connected group, crop foreground at the outer canvas edge, or resize one pose independently.

Keep the feet, base, or lower torso planted at the same coordinates across all eight frames. Express direction through the eyes, face, head, upper body, and physically appropriate prop movement, not by moving, rotating, or rescaling the entire sprite.

Place one centered pose in each invisible equal-width slot on flat pure blue #0000FF. Change only the natural parts needed to express gaze: eyes, eyelids, head, face, neck, upper body, appendages, and constrained prop follow-through. Keep identity, silhouette, materials, palette, markings, and props consistent.

ROW-BOUNDARY LOCK: 180 must continue directly from row 9's 157.5, matching its body size, baseline, planted anchor, expression, and construction. 337.5 must be one even 22.5-degree step before 000: nearly up-facing while remaining on the overall left-hand arc. Do not distort pupils, nose, or body geometry merely to exaggerate the subtle horizontal component.

PRE-RETURN CHECK: reject this result if it does not contain eight separated pose groups in the required order; neighboring poses overlap; foreground is cropped at the outer canvas edge; any frame changes sprite scale, body or head size, baseline, or planted-body position; the row visibly reverses into the wrong half of the loop; or 180 does not continue from 157.5 or 337.5 does not flow evenly into 000. Minor intermediate pupil or nose deviations are not rejection reasons. Exact cell cropping, resizing, and recentering happen deterministically after generation.

Do not rotate, skew, or tilt the whole sprite to fake gaze. Do not add replacement/googly eyes, labels, degree text, arrows, clocks, grids, shadows, glows, scenery, detached effects, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.


## prompts\rows\look-row-9.md

Create one horizontal look-direction strip for Codex pet `jade`, atlas row 9.

Use the attached canonical base, completed standard contact sheet, layout guide, and approved four-cardinal strip for identity, scale, registration, spacing, direction semantics, and cross-row continuity. Read `qa/look-mechanics.md` and follow its pet-specific movement and eye/prop mechanics. The approved cardinal strip is authoritative for the up, screen-right, down, and screen-left pose families. Interpolate the intermediate directions as even 22.5-degree steps between those anchors.

COHERENT SYNTHESIS LOCK: produce one unified eight-pose row. Do not paste, tile, or independently restyle individual cells. Every final cell must be drawn together with the same face construction, body proportions, line/render quality, lighting, materials, scale, baseline, and registration.

Output exactly 8 complete full-body frames in this exact left-to-right order: 000, 022.5, 045, 067.5, 090, 112.5, 135, 157.5. Degrees are clockwise: 000 is up, 090 right, 180 down, and 270 left. Neutral/front is not part of this row.

DIRECTION TARGETS — use these to shape the coherent row, not as pixel-level landmark gates:

1. `000`: vertical UP; no horizontal requirement.
2. `022.5`: horizontal SCREEN-RIGHT and vertical UP.
3. `045`: horizontal SCREEN-RIGHT and vertical UP.
4. `067.5`: horizontal SCREEN-RIGHT and vertical UP.
5. `090`: horizontal SCREEN-RIGHT; no vertical requirement.
6. `112.5`: horizontal SCREEN-RIGHT and vertical DOWN.
7. `135`: horizontal SCREEN-RIGHT and vertical DOWN.
8. `157.5`: horizontal SCREEN-RIGHT and vertical DOWN.

Cardinals must be unmistakable. Intermediate poses should broadly occupy the intended quadrant and advance naturally through the ordered loop. Minor pupil, nose, eyelid, or aiming-feature deviations are acceptable when the overall direction, continuity, identity, and motion remain coherent. Do not deform the character merely to make every intermediate axis independently obvious.

SCREEN-COORDINATE LOCK: screen-right means the viewer's right image edge, never the character's own right. The row should travel naturally through the right half of the loop. Near-vertical 022.5 and 157.5 may have subtle horizontal cues; prioritize a coherent arc over exact pupil or nose placement.

HARD LAYOUT AND CONTINUITY CONTRACT — DETERMINISTIC REGISTRATION: draw exactly eight separated pose groups in left-to-right direction order.

Change only the natural parts needed to express gaze: eyes, eyelids, head, face, neck, upper body, appendages, and constrained prop follow-through. Keep identity, silhouette, materials, palette, markings, and props consistent.

ROW-BOUNDARY LOCK: 157.5 must be one even 22.5-degree step before 180. Match the approved 180 pose's body size, baseline, planted anchor, expression, and construction. Preserve the overall right-hand arc, but do not distort pupils, nose, or body geometry merely to exaggerate the subtle horizontal component.

PRE-RETURN CHECK: reject this result if it does not contain eight separated pose groups in the required order; neighboring poses overlap; foreground is cropped at the outer canvas edge; any frame changes sprite scale, body or head size, baseline, or planted-body position; the row visibly reverses into the wrong half of the loop; or 157.5 does not flow evenly into 180. Minor intermediate pupil or nose deviations are not rejection reasons. Exact cell cropping, resizing, and recentering happen deterministically after generation.

## prompts\look-cardinals.md

Create one horizontal four-cardinal anchor strip for Codex pet `jade`.

Use the attached canonical base, completed standard contact sheet, and layout guide for exact identity, style, scale, baseline, face construction, materials, palette, markings, props, and spacing. Read `qa/look-mechanics.md` and use the pet's natural gaze mechanism.

Output exactly four centered complete full-body poses in this exact left-to-right order: `000 up`, `090 screen-right`, `180 down`, `270 screen-left`. Screen-left and screen-right always mean the viewer's image edges, never the character's own left or right.

For `000`, keep the face broadly frontal and point the eyes and natural head mechanism toward the TOP edge. For `090`, put the nose tip, pupils, face surface, or natural aiming feature on the screen-right side of the head center. For `180`, keep the face broadly frontal and point toward the BOTTOM edge. For `270`, apply the inverse screen-left landmark rule. Every cardinal must be unmistakable without labels.

Place one pose in each invisible equal-width slot on a flat pure blue #0000FF background with generous padding. Keep scale, feet/base, lower body, and registration consistent across all four slots.

Do not rotate, skew, or tilt the whole sprite to fake gaze. Do not add replacement eyes, labels, degree text, arrows, boxes, guide marks, shadows, scenery, detached effects, or chroma-key colors inside the pet.

Use case: identity-preserve. Asset: complete coherent eight-pose feline gaze sprite row.
Edit target is attached image FIVE, row10. Its LEFT ARC head directions are CORRECT. Make one targeted repair: make the entire eight-cat family about 10 percent SMALLER relative to exactly the same 2172x724 canvas. Keep all eight coherent and the same shared scale. Source silhouettes should be only 430 to 445 pixels tall including highest ear (about 60 percent of canvas height), NEVER over 450. Keep feet on y=634 baseline and tallest ears near y=190, with generous empty upper margin. Match reference FOUR row9 head/body source scale and body construction. Do NOT fill canvas height. This is a full-row resynthesis, not separate independently sized cats.
Input roles: ONE complete identity board combines user photos, approved standard animation contact and canonical cat; TWO layout spacing guide only, do not reproduce lines; THREE approved cardinal direction anchors; FOUR approved row9 source scale, style, body baseline, proportions; FIVE edit target, correct directional arc but too large.
Exactly eight separated full-body realistic tuxedo cats left to right: 180 DOWN (forehead visible and muzzle lowered toward paws); 202.5 down slightly SCREEN LEFT; 225 down SCREEN LEFT; 247.5 SCREEN LEFT slightly down; 270 pure SCREEN LEFT profile; 292.5 SCREEN LEFT slightly up; 315 up SCREEN LEFT; 337.5 nearly up and slightly SCREEN LEFT. For poses 6 and 7 the nose MUST remain LEFT of skull center, toward preceding cats. Pose8 approaches vertical up through LEFT hemisphere, never right. Preserve image5 head semantics.
Keep torso, feet, curled tail and lower belly patch planted in same position in each slot. Only head, neck, natural eyes/eyelids and whiskers follow gaze. SAME head size and torso size all eight. Thin white forehead blaze, white muzzle/chest, small lower belly patch, white toe tips, green eyes, natural black/pink nose, realistic fur exactly matching references. Complete ears, whiskers, tail and paws with clear separation and margins, no cropping or overlap.
Render one unified family, true transparent background and preserved alpha, no scenery, shadow, glow, labels, lines, arrows, props or effects. All eight full-body figures about430-445px high on2172x724canvas, ample empty space overhead.
